Bellows of pain
And scraping of chains
The echoes they taunt and deceive me
Oceans of blame
And rivers of shame
The fury it never leaves meGrief in the snow
The winter of woe
Has come here to judge and bereave me
Lock up the rage
It rattles the cage
The fury it never leaves meAlways within
To lurk in the skin
The wounds ever aching so deeply
Try as I may
To hide it away
The fury it never leaves me
